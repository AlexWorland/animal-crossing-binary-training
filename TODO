TODO:
	Add math for finding steps per epoch; not sure if it's automatic.
	# Update: It is automatic, but only for tensorflow datasets; if the
	data is loaded into a numpy array, it needs to be calculated
	manually.
	
	Get folder locations and experiment parameters from a text file if
	it exists-- else use hard-coded defaults like it is now.

	Pass nearly all global values into functions through main (most of
	them are fine though)

	Get image size from text file. Or just look at the image.
	
	Add more models.
	
	Add a free licence. I'm thinking MIT. So other people can take the
	code if they want.

	Make examples of error images
	
	Save weights to a file.
	
	Load our weights from a file.
